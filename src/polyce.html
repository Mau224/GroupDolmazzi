            Information Collected Using Cookies: Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer
            through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated
            with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell
            us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet. Our cookies do
            not, by themselves, contain Personal Information. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that
            your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services. Most browsers have an option for turning off the
            cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the
            sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a
            variety of ways. This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies
            by third parties, including our third party partners and service providers. We do not control when or how
            third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may
            set cookies on your computer. Ads appearing on the Services may be delivered to users by our advertising
            partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they
            send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
            information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe
            will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Dolmazzi Group, Inc. and
            does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, including advertisers or partners. Information
            Collected from Third Parties: If you choose to register on our Site or otherwise link your Dolmazzi Group,
            Inc. account with a third party’s service (such as Facebook), we may receive the same type of information
            we collect from you (described above) directly from those services. We may receive additional information
            about you, such as demographic data, employment information, social media networking and imprints or fraud
            detection information, from third party partners and service providers and combine it with other
            information that we have about you. Aggregate Information: We collect statistical information about how
            both users, collectively, use the Services (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived
            from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied
            back to you. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the
            Services so that we can make the Services appealing to as many users as possible, and improve the
            Services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about
            how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners
            also understand how often people use their services and the Services, so that they, too, may provide you
            with an optimal online experience.</p>
